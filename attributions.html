                    Our team in collaboration with the <b>iGEM Team of IISER Tirupati</b> had successfully organized the event of Gene Gala - a 5 day mini-summer camp on synthetic biology and its applications with female high school students. The participating students were from the schools under the Directorate of Education, Delhi. The whole event was conducted by effective contribution from both the teams. The 5-day presentation slides were designed and created by the IISER Kolkata team with relevant suggestions from IISER Tirupati team members. The content delivered and activities conducted in the workshop are products of effort from both teams. The day-wise handbook, quizzes, and the workshop plan document for reference of each dayâ€™s content that was provided to the students were created by iGEM IISER Tirupati team members with relevant suggestions from our team.
