                  <p>Education, in itself, is not merely the formal delivery of ideas and thoughts in the form of formalised packets of information. Rather, it dives deep into the exchange of information and ideas between different classes of people, communities and individuals which results in mutual development and the synergistic evolution of thought processes of all the parties involved in the process of interaction.</p>
                  <p>This is the central idea and notion on which our team laid the groundwork to execute a number of initiatives for imparting scientific education to people, involving individuals of diverse backgrounds, age-groups and educational levels. We have worked towards involving people and shaping their minds with regard to synthetic biology, with the principal objective of our initiatives being the establishment of a dialogue between different groups of people about synthetic biology and its various aspects.</p>
                  <p>With the help of constructive input and feedback and a collective team spirit, we have conducted workshops on synthetic biology, designed informative and educational graphical illustrations, conducted in-person interactions and collaborated with different organisations to publish material, organise competitions and conduct programs on science in general and synthetic biology in particular. Through our initiatives, we have tried to address issues beyond the task of imparting and exchanging knowledge of science and synthetic biology by trying to integrate under-represented communities and disadvantaged individuals who are likely to have less access to science education.</p>

                  <p>With the dairy industry being the core arena of focus of our project, it was inevitable that we work towards involving the dairy industry community and persons who are directly and indirectly associated with it in the conversation of the rising dynamic significance of synthetic biology and a general sense of awareness about it. We worked towards educating and inculcating a basic level of understanding among small dairy farmers who form the major fraction of the dairy industry in an agriculture-intensive country like India. The aim of our in-person visits and virtual interactions was to initiate a dialogue between different stakeholders of our project in the context of our project.</p>
                  <p>
                    We conducted in-person interviews, meetings and virtual interaction sessions with dairy farmers, veterinary doctors and managers of dairy companies to establish a dialogue on understanding the issue of bovine mastitis and its various aspects of importance with regard to different communities. For the small scale dairy farmer, the general understanding of the disease and ways to prevent it as well as the consequences of antibiotic overuse are all matters of significance where awareness and dissemination of scientific information is a necessary prerequisite to establish a foundational basis for dealing with the issue of bovine mastitis. On the other hand, managerial officials of dairy companies are more interested in the scaling of production options and the managing of large scale dairy farms. We worked towards making people aware of the issues
                    pertaining to AMR and its future ramifications. We also extensively discussed the issue of bovine mastitis, its impact on the dairy industry and the many issues it causes as well as the prevention techniques of mastitis.
                  </p>
                  <p>We understood the need of awareness of bovine mastitis amongst small scale dairy farmers in India from our interaction with the dairy farmers, veterinarian doctors and scientists. A proper awareness will be extremely instrumental in controlling the transmission of the disease and reducing its occurrence.</p>

                      <p>
                        Our team visited some scale small dairy farmers who aren't aware of the risks of antibiotics. We discussed their level of awareness of subclinical bovine mastitis, what they think are its causes and the treatment procedures they have adapted to over time. The aim was to educate them about bovine mastitis as well as the risks related to antibiotic overuse. We educated them on the prevention techniques of bovine mastitis and the importance of hygiene in dairy farms for the same. Keeping in mind the current limitations posed to public gatherings due to the pandemic, all such awareness programs were conducted in person to avoid any gathering following the COVID protocol officiated by the state government of West Bengal. By interacting with them we came to know of their perspectives on bovine mastitis. The interaction between us was productive and
                        we explained various aspects of AMR, bovine mastitis and the scope of synthetic <br />

                    As of 2020, almost a third of girls from the poorest strata have never seen a class room whereas upto 40% of adolescent girls are not attending school, as per a report of the Right to Education Forum and Centre for Budget Policy Studies ( supported by the world bank & UNICEF). Coupled with a poor compliance of the Right to education Act ( almost a decade after it was enacted ), the dripping finances spent in the sector of primary education has been primarily underscored as a central factor causinga rather less encouraging scenario when it comes to the hinterlands and the poorest pockets of India. Home to a substantial number of children ( girls accounting for a major chunk)who are out of school, studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between public investment in primary education and the overall development of children.<a

                    However , among the brighter points to mention, the percentage of Indian women who graduate in STEM is higher than many nations such as the US, Germany, UK and France, as per the information disseminated by the Union Minister of Education in the lower house of parliament<a class="referenceLinks" href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/education/percentage-of-stem-women-graduates-in-india-higher-compared-to-us-uk-govt-121071901120_1.html">[2]</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is indeed an optimistic scenario and one that needs to be built upon it. The number of Indian women opting STEM for higher education has consistently increased in the past few years, although challenges remain. In order to ensure the holistic development of STEM as a sector which attracts women equivocally, it is important to focus on the aspects of job creation for women which continues to be a problem, as a higher percentage of women in STEM higher education may not necessarily translate into jobs <a class="referenceLinks" href="https://theprint.in/india/education/women-in-stem-the-growing-numbers-challenges-and-whether-it-translates-into-jobs/700564/">[3].</a> As a matter of fact, the development of an environment ensuring equitable job opportunities representation for women would inspire female students to take up STEM for higher studies
                    which shall encourage young girls to inquire about different scientific ideas and cultivate their scientific temper. This would not just bolster female representation in science but contribute to the overall development of a society guided by scientific notions and principles, without neglecting anyone.

Simply titled ‘GENE GALA’, the workshop was an integrated effort on the part of the two teams to shape young minds and contribute to the repertoire of their knowledge on the fundamentals of synthetic biology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our team acknowledges the need for an inclusive and interactive modus operandi for the purpose of reaching out to students in order to understand science and cultivate critical thinking in a holistic manner. The workshop lasted for 5 days and registered the attendance of upto 75 female students from a number of schools run by the Directorate of Education, Delhi as well as their school teachers. Cultivating the fundamentals of synthetic biology in the minds of young students is quintessential for initiating or establishing a dialogue among communities regarding how synthetic biology works in real life. Our workshop was designed keeping in mind the curriculum and the level of understanding of high school students in general in the Indian educational system, elucidating on the pedagogy of high school and senior secondary schooling. We ensured that the
                    collaboration was not merely a rudimentary extrapolation of what one would learn in the classroom but extended beyond the horizon by incorporating everyday activities on a range of topics from basic molecular biology to genetic engineering and puzzles involving elements of biology. Each day, essentially, was a session of about an hour or more which involved lectures by the team members on a specific topic assigned on that day, followed by a small session on a daily activity which would be solved by the team members the next day, thereby providing ample time to the attendees to solve the problem on their own!

                      <p>The 5-day workshop, conducted as a crash course on the fundamentals of synthetic biology, entailed multiple components which could be conveniently used to educate students via an online platform and can also serve as potential tools of improvisation to educators in the context of teaching high school students the basics of synthetic biology. A brochure (created by IISER Tirupati with inputs from IISER Kolkata) to provide an overview of our workshop to interested students who wish to join, was circulated among them We go on to describe in detail the multitude of modules as well as the structure and execution of the collaborative event between the two teams in the following section.</p>

                        The entire duration of 5days was planned in a way so that one could cover the essentials of molecular biology and advance onto the stepping stone to synthetic biology. The comprehensive and integrated approach of the designed lesson plan was possible due to the fruitful collaboration between the two teams. The first day dealt with the basics of biomolecular structures, the central dogma and how codons are read during translation. This was followed with the second day where we discussed bacterial genetics with a specific focus on operons. The third day heralded the beginning of synthetic biology, starting from the fundamentals. We discussed about plasmids along with a brief introduction to how experiments in molecular cloning are done. The fourth day covered crucial themes as we discussed the applications of synthetic biology, an introduction to
                        genetic circuits, the significance of ethics in synthetic biology followed by an introduction to what iGEM, and henceforth imparting the flavour of interdisciplinary science to the students with a brief discussion on chemical kinetics and molecular modelling. The two teams also described their iGEM projects to the attendees during the lecture session. The last day was a brainstorming session where we asked students to come up with interesting ideas to solve real-world problems!

                      <p>The lectures were delivered each of the 4 days ( excluding the ideathon at the end ) by a pair of students , one from each team, with the content being prepared focusing on the need for learning with illustrations and explanation rather than monotonous lines of text in the slides. The lecture was usually delivered in a time frame of about 40 minutes, following which the students were assigned breakout rooms where they could interact with the mentors ( one team member of each team being assigned a breakout room, thereby 2 mentors per room).. We had a holistic session of interaction with the students at a personal level each day, as the mentors helped them clarify their doubts and undertake the everyday task. <b>The slides for each day have been duly prepared by the two teams with inputs from each other. </b></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>The activities and quizzes accompanying each day’s lecture,were designed in order to inculcate critical thinking in the minds of the students by assigning them interesting tasks and questions every day. The mentors, during the discussion, discussed the activities and provided a hint to the students following which they were expected to answer the activity question by the next activity session. The activity questions for each day can be found at the end of each lecture slide. We also circulated a handbook among the students after every session everyday summarising the lecture content. (Activities were designed by both the teams and the handbooks were created by IISER Tirupati)</p>

                      <p>Finally, in order to assess the efficiency of our skills to educate young minds, we circulated a feedback form among the students as well as their teachers who attended our workshop. We have received both commendation and suggestions both from the students as well as the teachers, which helped us to understand the finer details of where we could have done better in this collaborative event. In a nutshell, this workshop has been a learning experience for the teams as well as the students, as we educated the students and the students taught us how to improvise our methods and tools of teaching!</p>

                    Our team conducted a one-day webinar for high school students in the Bengali language on the basics of molecular and synthetic biology. We witnessed an attendance of upto 45 students from various schools and circulated a feedback form amongst the attendees. The reviews were mostly positive with suggestions.
                  </p>
                  <p>With the Indian constitution officially recognising 22 languages, the Indian linguistic space is supplemented by several other languages and dialects giving rise to a complex and diverse network of linguistic networks operating throughout the country. With many children growing up in a usually bilingual or trilingual environment at home, english education is mostly imparted at the primary level in private schools. Public schools usually adopt to the vernacular medium, although there has been consistent efforts to incorporate more of english at the primary level in the public education sector. <a class="referenceLinks" href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/what-languages-are-spoken-in-india/">[4]</a></p>
                  <p>In a linguistically diverse country like India, the holistic cultivation of scientific temper is not possible if the need for linguistically diverse scientific education is not acknowledged or addressed. It is only when the dissemination of educational material is pursued in multiple languages without any preformed bias Our team was enthusiastic about the prospects of conducting a one-day webinar for students across schools in the state of West Bengal. We circulated the details of our events and witnessed an attendance of upto 45 students. The webinar was conducted on the 6th of August completely in bengali. The webinar went on for about 3 hours where the team members fluent in bengali delivered the lecture content to enthusiastic high school students.</p>
                  <p>Feedback is an essential part of assessing ones efficiency in conducting any event. For SynKTBio, we circulated a feedback form to the participants asking if they learnt anything from our webinar and whether it motivated them to pursue science as a career in higher education. We also inquired about suggestions from the students in the feedback form and asked them to rate our webinar. Most of our attendees are currently in their 9th and 10th standards. We have received mostly positive feedback for the event with almost 80 % of the responses rating our webinar 5 on a scale of 1 to 5 with another 14% rating it 4 out of 5. A sound majority of about 62.8 % reponses were in the positive when asked if the webinar motivated them to pursue scientific research as a career option!</p>
                  <p>We have had an amazing experience with all the student attendees of our webinar and are happy to receive their enthusiastic responses to our feedback form. We have put some special responses from the feedback form below !</p>

                    An exciting illustrative story to ignite the youngest of minds and an innovative tool for educators/ parents/ guardians to cultivate scientific temper in the minds of children
                  </p>
                  <p>Research has shown that the use of cartoons in educational practice positively affects academic outcomes. The use of cartoons in education leads to an increased level of knowledge retention in the minds of children. In a nutshell, both academic achievements and knowledge retention are positively influenced by the inclusion of cartoons in educational activities.<a class="referenceLinks" href="http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_14_December_2014/25.pdf">[5]</a>. They inevitably make the process of learning easier and more engaging for children. A single cartoon can substitute for several pages of text, making learning not just engaging but efficient, convenient and comprehensible for students.<a class="referenceLinks" href="https://targetstudy.com/articles/importance-of-cartoons-in-teaching.html">[6]</a></p>
                  <p>Our team has designed a picture storybook for children for the ages of 10 years and younger. We have designed and developed this storybook as a preliminary introduction for young children to the concept of science and the ability to imagine and think about exciting ideas! We acknowledge the significance of visually attractive illustrations in cultivating different ideas right from one’s childhood and this storybook is a step in the same direction.</p>
                  <p>This storybook can be used in different ways by different persons. It can act as educational material at the primary or kindergarten level of schooling. Teachers and instructors can help the students understand the meaning of any word or concept they find hard to understand. We have tried to represent everyday science in the form of illustrations to spark interest in the minds of children at the grassroot level. The picture book can also be used by parents or guardians and can read it out to their children. As children read our storybook, they would also exchange ideas they got from our book with other children, thereby sparking the same interest and curiosity in their minds as well!</p>
                  <p>Our storybook brings Tom and Jerry, unarguably the most famous cartoon characters of one’s childhood. The story is about Jerry being given a Green fluorescent potion by Merry and his subsequent ability to glow. We have tried to emphasise how GFP works at a very preliminary level without going into the intricate details of the science behind it by crafting the element of the green fluorescent potion. By means of this storybook, we have emphasised on our message that advances in science should happen primarily for the benefit of society and not to give rise to some sort of adverse circumstances or conflict or the other.</p>
                  <p>For the purpose of feedback, we have attached a feedback form at the very beginning of the storybook where readers can let us know their feedback and suggestions for possible improvements. We have incorporated some lovely feedback from children who read our story book and the story book itself right below !</p>

                    In order to spread the word of synthetic biology and involve more people in the discussion of its ideas and inculcate the same in the minds of those who aren’t aware of it, we employed two unconventional educational tools, music and literature, with an interesting twist!
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Syn-Chrome </b></p>
                  <p>
                    We collaborated with the music club of our institute, IISER Kolkata, to conduct an event named “Syn-Chrome”. A unique competition aimed at expressing the beauty of science through music, the event consisted of two categories i.e. “Parodification” and “Vigyangeet”, the second of which literally translates to “ science song” . In the first category, participants had to choose any popular song and modify it with their own lyrics to create a song of their own. The theme of the category being “synthetic biology”, parodification was an enthusiastic venture undertaken to popularise the various ideas and concepts of synthetic biology among people who are not or less aware of the same. The usage of tools such as music and other forms of art in the process of education or learning has always been an interesting approach. By collaborating with the cultural
                    clubs of our institute, we have attempted to utilise some of the various alternative tools that can be used as an effective means of disseminating information and educating people about synthetic biology!
                  </p>
                  <p>The second category, “Vigyangeet”, was where the participants had to use their creativity to compose a completely original song!. This time we kept the theme simply “biology”. We circulated the posters, rulebook and registration form for this event among the student community of IISER Kolkata and received some amazing entries from the participants which we are happy to put on our page right below !</p>
                  <p><b>Bio-katha </b></p>
                  <p>Our next collaboration was with the literary club of IISER Kolkata. We collaborated for two events, titled “Bio-Katha” and “Ink-Life’. The objective of these competitions was to combine one’s enthusiasm for research with their knack for writing , providing an opportunity for students to explore the world of biology, which itself was the theme.</p>
                  <p>In Bio-Katha, participants were required to submit a fictional story and let their imagination and originality run amok. Ink-life ( non-fiction) was a creative essay writing contest where the participants had to put their own spin on the narrative while still remaining scientifically accurate. We have received amazing submissions from the IISER Kolkata student community and we are delighted to put them here!</p>

                    Our team organised visits to disseminate scientific information and inculcate awareness in people who are underprivileged to have proper access to scientific knowledge and information. Our team members visited a nearby old-age home and an orphanage to raise awareness on a range of issues, from the importance of not missing one’s antibiotic doses to how antibiotics work and the use of basic scientific instruments. Our aim has been to reach out to every possible section of society and in doing so, impart scientific information to people who haven’t been able to get access to such information and enhance their arena of awareness in order to build a better society for the future. Due to the pandemic , we have ensured that all in-person interactions are undertaken with the utmost caution keeping in mind proper measures of social distancing and a limited
                    number of persons.

                      <p>Our team undertook a very special visit to an old age home where we aimed to educate the people about the importance of taking one’s antibiotic doses on time. We designed an illustrative poster in English and Bengali, highlighting what antibiotics are, how they work and what can possibly happen when antibiotic doses can be missed. The posters have been designed such that the information in them can be conveyed easily without the use of much jargon. The aim of the visit was to inculcate scientific awareness in the minds of the people residing there with regard to antibiotics at a very preliminary level. We have attached the posters that we have designed right below!</p>

                        Our visit to an orphanage was full of enthusiasm and delight as we demonstrated to the children there the usage of foldscope, the origami based paper microscope developed with the aim to make science more accessible. The children at the orphanage were enthusiastic to learn the technicalities of using the foldscope microscope which we taught them to use to view objects. The aim of this visit was to spark the curiosity and interest to learn new things in the young minds at the orphanage who have been less fortunate than many others with proper access to quality education. This was a small initiative on our part to promote scientific education in the context of the bigger task of working for the ones who have the zeal but not the predicament to pursue their interests. We have put below some photographs of the delightful interaction our team had
                        with the children.

                        We teamed up with NGSF ( next gen scientists foundation) to provide a detailed overview of our project and opined our perspectives on the growing interests of the scientific community in the arena of synthetic biology and its various potential effects and consequences. The interview mainly centering on the general idea of synthetic biology and its aspects through the lens of our project, we documented the practical implications of our idea and how it can be realised. We expect that this blog entry by us will enhance awareness among people regarding the aspects, applications and potential of synthetic biology both in the present as well as the future. Our responses have been documented in the form of a conversation. Check out our interview with NGSF

                        In collaboration with the ASPIC club of Yuvaraja's college, Mysuru , we organised a video podcast on the issue of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic Stewardship and Prevention of Infection in Communities (ASPIC) Clubs Network promote social awareness among people on antimicrobial resistance through different modes. In the podcast, we talked about the growing risk of antibiotic resistance and the irrational use of antibiotics, among other topics, in reference to our project. We also gave a brief overview of our project and majorly focused on how subclinical bovine mastitis is adding to the burden of AMR. We discussed the various potential reasons why farmers resort to the usage of antibiotics. We also discussed how synthetic biology can be utilised to tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance. We had a delightful discussion with the ASPIC club
                        and we are hopeful that our discussion will help inculcate awareness and educate many people about the risks of antibiotic overuse within the reach of the ASPIC club of Yuvaraja's College.

                        In collaboration with Cogito137 , a web-based science communication platform based at IISER Kolkata, we conducted a webinar where we presented our project and discussed its various aspects. The presentation was a part of Biology Week, IISER Kolkata chapter, a showcase event of the Royal society of Biology. Our team member Shreyash Borkar presented our project, elaborated on how Bovine mastitis is harming the dairy industry and how our project can prevent it. We extensively discussed our project and its implications for the dairy industry, the issue of antibiotic resistance and the ways in which our project aims to tackle it. We also elaborated on the possible issues and perceptions affecting people when it comes to mainstreaming GMO-based products and how we are effectively employing different measures to ensure our product is safe and
                        trustworthy for the market. It was a very productive discussion and we hope that it will inculcate awareness and educate people about synbio and its applications among those in Cogito 137’s target audience.
